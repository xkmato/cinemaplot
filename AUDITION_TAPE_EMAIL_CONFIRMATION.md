# Audition Tape Email Confirmation Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically sends email confirmations to people who submit audition tapes through CinemaPlot. The confirmation email lets them know their submission was received and sets expectations for next steps.

## What Changed

  - Confirmation that their tape was received
  - Event and role details
  - Clear 7-day expectation for hearing back
  - Guidelines and important notes
  - Professional styling matching CinemaPlot branding

### 2. Updated Submission Process (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)

- Modified `submitAuditionTape()` function to send confirmation emails
- Email is sent immediately after successful tape submission
- Includes error handling - submission won't fail if email fails

### 3. Form Updates (`components/submit-audition-tape.tsx`)

- Made email address required (was previously optional)
- Added helpful text: "We'll send you a confirmation email when your tape is received"
- Updated form validation to require email
- Added basic email format validation

### 4. Success Message Update (`components/event-detail-client.tsx`)

- Updated success message to mention email confirmation
- Sets clear expectation: "Expect to hear from us within 7 days"

### 5. Testing Endpoint (`app/api/test-email/route.ts`)

- Extended existing test endpoint to support audition confirmation emails
- Can test both welcome emails and audition confirmation emails
- Usage: `GET /api/test-email?type=audition-confirmation`

## Email Content

## Technical Details

### Dependencies

- Uses existing Mailgun integration
- Requires `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`, and `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL` environment variables

### Error Handling

- Email sending errors are logged but don't prevent tape submission
- Graceful degradation if email service is unavailable

### Email Tracking

- Emails are tagged with `audition-confirmation` and `audition-tape` for analytics
- Includes tracking for opens and clicks

## Testing

1. Submit an audition tape with a valid email address
2. Check that confirmation email is received
3. Verify email content is properly formatted
