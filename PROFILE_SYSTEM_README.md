# User Profile System Enhancement

## Overview

This update implements a comprehensive user profile system with persistent data storage and username-based routing for CinemaPlot.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Profile Interface

- **Professional Layout**: Modern card-based design with tabs for different content sections
- **Comprehensive Profile Fields**:
  - Display name and email
  - Custom username with validation
  - Bio and portfolio description
  - Location and website
  - Film roles selection (29+ predefined roles)
  - Achievements list
- **Real-time Editing**: Inline editing with save/cancel functionality
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Shows total works, views, and average ratings

### 2. Persistent Data Storage

- **Firestore Integration**: All profile data is automatically saved to Firestore
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately persisted and reflected in the UI
- **Data Validation**: Username validation with uniqueness checking
- **Automatic Initialization**: New user profiles are created automatically

### 3. Username-based Routing

- **Custom URLs**: Users with usernames get clean URLs like `yoursite.com/username`
- **Fallback Support**: Users without usernames still use `/profile/[uid]` URLs
- **Smart Redirection**: Automatic redirection from UID routes to username routes when available
- **Reserved Paths Protection**: Middleware prevents conflicts with existing routes

### 4. Enhanced Sharing

- **Intelligent URL Sharing**: Share button uses username URLs when available, UID URLs otherwise
- **Multiple Share Options**: WhatsApp, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, copy link, and native device sharing
- **URL Display**: Clear indication of available profile URLs

## File Structure

### New Files

- `/app/[username]/page.tsx` - Username-based profile route
- `/middleware.ts` - Route protection and username routing logic

### Modified Files

- `/app/profile/[uid]/page.tsx` - Enhanced profile page with persistence and better UX

## Technical Implementation

### Profile Data Interface

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string;
  displayName?: string;
  email?: string;
  username?: string;
  bio?: string;
  roles?: string[];
  location?: string;
  website?: string;
  joinedAt?: string;
  portfolioDescription?: string;
  achievements?: string[];
  socialLinks?: {
    twitter?: string;
    linkedin?: string;
    instagram?: string;
    website?: string;
  };
}
```

### Firestore Collections

- `users/{uid}` - User profile data
- `usernames/{username}` - Username to UID mapping for fast lookups

### Username Validation Rules

- Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only
- 3-30 characters in length
- Must be unique across the platform
- Case-insensitive storage and lookups

## User Experience Improvements

4. Fill out bio, location, roles, and other profile information
5. Add portfolio description and achievements for a professional presentation

### For Developers

1. Profile data is automatically persisted to Firestore

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of non-existent usernames
- Fallback to UID routes when username routes fail
- Clear error messages for validation failures

This enhancement transforms the basic profile system into a comprehensive, professional portfolio platform that users can be proud to share.
