# Audition Tape Email Confirmation & Notification System

## Overview

This comprehensive feature automatically sends email confirmations to people who submit audition tapes AND email notifications to event owners when they receive new audition submissions through CinemaPlot. This creates a complete communication loop for the audition process.

## What Changed

### 1. Enhanced Email Functions (`lib/email-service.ts`)

- **Added** `sendAuditionTapeConfirmationEmail()` - For submitters
- **Added** `sendAuditionTapeNotificationEmail()` - For event owners
- **Added** `getUserById()` - Helper to fetch user data including email
- **Added** `AuditionTapeConfirmationData` & `AuditionTapeNotificationData` interfaces
- Professional HTML email templates for both types with:
  - Confirmation that tape was received (submitter)
  - New submission alert with all details (event owner)
  - Clear 7-day expectation setting
  - Professional styling matching CinemaPlot branding

### 2. Updated Submission Process (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)

- Modified `submitAuditionTape()` function to send TWO emails:
  1. **Confirmation email** to the person who submitted the tape
  2. **Notification email** to the event owner about the new submission
- Fetches event owner details from database using their user ID
- Includes comprehensive error handling - submission won't fail if emails fail

### 3. Form Updates (`components/submit-audition-tape.tsx`)

- Made email address required (was previously optional)
- Added helpful text: "We'll send you a confirmation email when your tape is received"
- Updated form validation to require email
- Added basic email format validation

### 4. Success Message Update (`components/event-detail-client.tsx`)

- Updated success message to mention email confirmation
- Sets clear expectation: "Expect to hear from us within 7 days"

### 5. Enhanced Testing Endpoint (`app/api/test-email/route.ts`)

- Extended existing test endpoint to support both email types
- Can test welcome, audition confirmation, and audition notification emails
- Usage:
  - `GET /api/test-email?type=audition-confirmation` (for submitters)
  - `GET /api/test-email?type=audition-notification` (for event owners)

- Graceful degradation if email service is unavailable
- Safe user data fetching with null checks

### Email Tracking

- Both email types are tagged for analytics:

  - Owner emails: `audition-notification`, `event-owner`
