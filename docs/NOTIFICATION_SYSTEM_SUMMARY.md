# Daily Notification Email System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Built

I've implemented a complete daily notification email system that sends users an email digest of their unread notifications every day at 5 PM. Here's what was created:

## 📁 New Files Created

### Core Service Layer

- **`lib/notification-email-service.ts`** - Main service for handling notification emails
  - Fetches users with unread notifications
  - Generates beautiful HTML and plain text email content
  - Handles bulk email sending with rate limiting
  - Error handling and logging

### API Endpoints

- **`app/api/cron/daily-notifications/route.ts`** - Production endpoint for daily cron jobs

  - Secured with optional API key authentication
  - Returns statistics about emails sent
  - Comprehensive error handling

- **`app/api/test/notification-digest/route.ts`** - Testing endpoint
  - Get stats about users with unread notifications
  - Send test digests to specific users or everyone
  - Perfect for development and testing

### Setup and Testing Tools

- **`scripts/setup-daily-notifications.sh`** - Automated setup script

  - Checks environment configuration
  - Generates secure API keys
  - Creates Vercel cron configuration
  - Provides deployment instructions

- **`scripts/test-notifications.js`** - Node.js testing tool
  - Test all endpoints programmatically
  - Check user statistics
  - Validate cron functionality

### Documentation

- **`DAILY_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide
  - Environment configuration
  - Deployment options (Vercel, external cron, server cron)
  - Testing instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Smart User Filtering

- Only sends emails to users who actually have unread notifications
- Efficiently queries Firebase to minimize unnecessary API calls

### 📧 Beautiful Email Design

- Professional HTML emails with CinemaPlot branding
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Up to 10 most recent notifications displayed
- Direct links to view full notifications
- Plain text fallback for all email clients

### 🛡️ Security & Rate Limiting

- Optional API key authentication for cron endpoints
- Built-in delays between emails to prevent rate limiting
- Comprehensive error handling that doesn't crash the system

### 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

- Detailed logging of all email activity
- Success/failure statistics
- Individual user email results
- Timestamp tracking for audit trails

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure

- Multiple testing endpoints for development
- Command-line tools for easy testing
- Statistics endpoints to monitor system health

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Quick Setup

```bash
# Run the automated setup script
npm run notifications:setup

# Or manually:
./scripts/setup-daily-notifications.sh
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Required: Mailgun (already configured)
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_domain
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=notifications@yourdomain.com

# Optional: Security
CRON_API_KEY=auto_generated_secure_key

# Required: URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Vercel (Automatic)

The setup script creates `vercel.json` with cron configuration:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-notifications",
      "schedule": "0 17 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option B: External Cron Service

Configure any cron service to call:

- URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/daily-notifications`
- Method: `POST`
- Schedule: `0 17 * * *` (5 PM daily)
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

### 4. Testing

```bash
# Check who would receive emails
npm run notifications:stats

# Send test emails
npm run notifications:test

# Test production endpoint
npm run notifications:cron

# Or use the detailed test tool
node scripts/test-notifications.js all
```

## 📈 What Happens Daily at 5 PM

1. **Query Phase**: System finds all users with unread notifications
2. **Processing Phase**: For each user:
   - Fetches their unread notifications
   - Generates personalized email content
   - Sends email via Mailgun
   - Logs results
3. **Completion**: Returns statistics about emails sent

## 🎨 Email Content

Users receive beautiful emails containing:

- Personal greeting with their name
- Count of unread notifications
- List of up to 10 most recent notifications with:
  - Notification title and message
  - Time stamp ("2 hours ago", "3 days ago")
  - Direct links to view full content
- Quick action buttons to view all notifications
- Professional CinemaPlot branding

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Change Email Timing

Modify the cron schedule:

- `0 17 * * *` = 5 PM daily (current)
- `0 9 * * *` = 9 AM daily
- `0 20 * * 1-5` = 8 PM weekdays only

### Customize Email Content

Edit templates in `lib/notification-email-service.ts`:

- `createNotificationDigestHTML()` - HTML version
- `createNotificationDigestText()` - Plain text version

### Adjust Rate Limiting

Change the delay between emails in `sendDailyNotificationDigests()`:

```typescript
// Current: 1 second delay
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
```

## 📊 Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive logging:

- Total users processed
- Successful email sends
- Failed email attempts
- Individual user results
- Detailed error messages

Check your application logs for entries prefixed with:

- `Daily notification digest process`
- `Sending daily notification digest`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Push your code and configure the cron job
2. **Test**: Use the testing tools to verify everything works
3. **Monitor**: Check logs to ensure emails are being sent
4. **Customize**: Adjust timing or content as needed

## 💡 Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be easily extensible:

- User preference settings for digest frequency
- Different email templates for different notification types
- A/B testing for email content
- Analytics dashboard for email performance
- Bulk unsubscribe management

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If no emails are being sent:

1. Check Mailgun configuration
2. Verify users have unread notifications: `npm run notifications:stats`
3. Check application logs for errors
4. Test endpoints manually

The system is robust and designed to handle edge cases gracefully!
