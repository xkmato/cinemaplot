# Timeout Error Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing `TimeoutError` exceptions with error code 23 (`TIMEOUT_ERR`) during Firebase Firestore operations, particularly when loading user profile data during authentication.

## Error Details

```
[Error [TimeoutError]: The operation was aborted due to timeout] {
  code: 23,
  TIMEOUT_ERR: 23,
  // ... other DOM error constants
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The timeout errors were occurring in the `onAuthStateChanged` effect in `lib/auth-context.tsx` where:

1. **Slow Firestore Operations**: The `getDoc()` calls to load user profile data were taking longer than expected
2. **No Timeout Handling**: The original code didn't have any timeout protection for Firestore operations
3. **Blocking Authentication**: Slow Firestore operations were blocking the entire authentication flow

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Timeout Protection

Enhanced the authentication context with `Promise.race()` to add 10-second timeouts to all Firestore operations:

```typescript
// Before: Unprotected Firestore call
const docSnap = await getDoc(userDocRef);

// After: Protected with timeout
const docSnap = await Promise.race([
  getDoc(userDocRef),
  new Promise<never>((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout loading user profile")), 10000)
  ),
]);
```

### 2. Error Handling and Fallbacks

Added comprehensive error handling with fallback strategies:

```typescript
try {
    // Attempt to load user profile with timeout
    const docSnap = await Promise.race([...]);
    // Handle success case
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading user profile:', error);
    // Fallback to basic user data from Firebase Auth
    setUser({
        uid: currentUser.uid,
        email: currentUser.email,
        displayName: currentUser.displayName,
        username: null
    });
}
```

### 3. Protected User Profile Creation

Also added timeout protection to user profile creation operations:

```typescript
await Promise.race([
  setDoc(userDocRef, {
    displayName: currentUser.displayName,
    email: currentUser.email,
  }),
  new Promise<never>((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout creating user profile")), 10000)
  ),
]);
```

### 4. Enhanced Profile Refresh Function

Updated the `refreshUserProfile()` function with the same timeout protection:

```typescript
const refreshUserProfile = async () => {
  if (!user?.uid) return;

  try {
    const userDocRef = doc(
      db,
      `artifacts/${appId}/public/data/users`,
      user.uid
    );
    const docSnap = await Promise.race([
      getDoc(userDocRef),
      new Promise<never>((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(
          () => reject(new Error("Timeout refreshing user profile")),
          10000
        )
      ),
    ]);
    // Handle response...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error refreshing user profile:", error);
  }
};
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### 1. Improved Reliability

- **No More Hanging**: Operations won't hang indefinitely waiting for slow Firestore responses
- **Graceful Degradation**: If profile loading fails, users still get basic authentication functionality
- **Better User Experience**: Authentication flow continues even if profile loading encounters issues

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout prevents indefinite waiting
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always provides basic user data from Firebase Auth as a fallback
- **Proper Logging**: Error logging helps with debugging and monitoring

### 3. Maintained Functionality

- **Full Feature Preservation**: All existing functionality remains intact
- **Profile Loading**: Profile data still loads when Firestore operations succeed
- **Username Support**: Username functionality continues to work as expected

## Testing Results

### Before Fix

- Frequent timeout errors in console
- Authentication flow could hang
- Poor user experience during slow network conditions

### After Fix

- Clean server startup without timeout errors
- Smooth authentication flow regardless of Firestore response times
- Fallback ensures users can always access the application

## Technical Implementation Details

### Promise.race() Pattern

Used `Promise.race()` to implement timeout functionality:

- **First Promise**: The actual Firestore operation
- **Second Promise**: A rejection after timeout period
- **Result**: Whichever completes first (success or timeout) determines the outcome

### TypeScript Typing

Properly typed the timeout promise as `Promise<never>` to ensure correct type inference:

```typescript
new Promise<never>((_, reject) =>
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout message")), 10000)
);
```

### Error Recovery Strategy

1. **Catch timeout errors**: Handle both network timeouts and our custom timeout errors
2. **Log for debugging**: Console.error for development and debugging
3. **Fallback gracefully**: Use Firebase Auth data when profile loading fails
4. **Continue flow**: Don't block the authentication process

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### What to Watch For

- Monitor console for "Error loading user profile" messages
- Check if timeout errors still occur (they should be handled gracefully now)
- Verify that users can still access all functionality even during Firestore issues

### Future Improvements

1. **Retry Logic**: Could add retry mechanisms for failed operations
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement progressive delays for retries
3. **Health Monitoring**: Add application health checks for Firestore connectivity
4. **User Feedback**: Consider showing loading states or connectivity issues to users

This fix ensures the application remains responsive and functional even under adverse network conditions while maintaining all existing functionality.
