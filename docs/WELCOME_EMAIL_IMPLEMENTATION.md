```

```bash
# Add to .env file
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_private_api_key_here
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.yourdomain.com
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@mg.yourdomain.com
```

### 3. DNS Configuration (for production)

```bash
# Add DNS records provided by Mailgun:
# - TXT record for domain verification
# - DKIM keys for authentication
# - MX records for receiving
# - CNAME for tracking
```

### 4. Testing

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit test interface
http://localhost:3000/test/email

# Or test via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test/welcome-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","displayName":"Test User"}'
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Welcome Email Triggers

1. **Google OAuth Users**: Email sent when profile is created with displayName
2. **Email Link Users**: Email sent when user submits their name
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracked per user session to prevent multiple sends

### Email Service Architecture

```typescript
// Core service
sendWelcomeEmail(userData: WelcomeEmailData): Promise<boolean>

// Helper functions
triggerWelcomeEmail() // Client-side trigger
markWelcomeEmailSent() // Tracking
hasWelcomeEmailBeenSent() // Duplicate check
```

### Error Handling
