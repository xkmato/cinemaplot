FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy coffee shop filled with the chatter of morning customers. Steam rises from countless cups as baristas work behind the counter.

SARAH, mid-20s, hurries in wearing scrubs, looking exhausted from a long night shift.

SARAH
(to the BARISTA)
Can I get a large coffee, please? Extra shot.

BARISTA
Coming right up!

Sarah checks her phone, noticing several missed calls.

SARAH
(muttering to herself)
This is not how I wanted to start my day.

The BARISTA slides a steaming cup across the counter.

BARISTA
That'll be four fifty.

Sarah fumbles for her wallet, accidentally knocking over a stack of napkins.

SARAH
Sorry! I'm usually more coordinated than this.

She pays and heads toward the door, taking a grateful sip of her coffee.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Sarah steps outside into the bright morning sunlight, finally feeling human again.

FADE OUT.
